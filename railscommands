There are basically 3 Types of Environment -->
Development

Root route is important because in production the default page doesnot shows..
To create root route we go in routes.rb file and type -->  root to: "main#index"
To correctly route pages Through application.html.erb File, we should have <%= yield %> tag in body
* We can render another view inside our layout and To do that we use partial render--> <%= render partial: "shared/navbar" %> 
  Here shared is folder in views and navbar represents the partial render html file which is named as --> _navbar.html.erb  (underscore represents partial) *
* Ruby helper --> link_to ( used for generating links directly passing to routes without requiring to change names multiple times )
  <%= link_to "About Us", about_path, class:"nav-link" %> (example of helper) 1st Parameter is description,2nd Parameter is route, 3rd is to map to html page  *
